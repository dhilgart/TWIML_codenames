TWIML_codenames_API_Server.py: containing functions called by the server for TWIMLfest 2020 codenames competition
Dan Hilgart <dhilgart@gmail.com>

Contains 4 class definitions:
    Clientlist : Keeps track of which clients are currently actively interacting with the server
    Client : Stores info about an individual client
    Gamelist : Keeps track of which games are currently in progress and stores info for those that have completed
    MongoLogger : Interfaces with MongoDB to write the log for an individual game

Contains 7 functions:
    validate(player_id, player_key) [bool] : returns True if the player_key is the correct one for the player_id
    send_as_bytes(var_to_send) [fastapi.Response] : converts any object (including a dict filled with various objects)
        into bytes to be sent via the API
    get_leaderboards(db) [dict] : pulls the current leaderboards from the players MongoDB
    list_player_games(player_to_pull, db) [list[int]] : returns a list of game_ids for all games this player is/was
        involved in
    list_completed_games(db) [list[int]] : returns a list of game_ids for all completed games
    pull_game_log(game_id, player_id, db) [dict] : returns the game log for an individual game
    scrub_game_log(game_dict, player_id) [dict] : removes info from the game log that would not be known to the
        player_id who is pulling the log

Contains the following global variables (set at the bottom of this file):
    client_active_timeout [timedelta] : how often a client needs to interact with the server to remain active
    wait_to_start_first_game [timedelta] : how long to wait after a client logs in to the server for the first time
        before requesting template bots to initiate a new game
    wait_to_start_subsequent_games [timedelta] : how long to wait after a client finishes a game before requesting
        template bots to initiate a new game
    wait_to_start [timedelta] : how long to wait after a client's .waiting_for_game_since before requesting  template
        bots to initiate a new game
    wait_after_game [timedelta] : how much time to add on to a client's .waiting_for_game_since after a game is
        completed
    min_clients_to_start_new_game [int] : how large the queue of available players needs to be before a new game can be
        started
    max_active_games_per_player [int] : how many games a player can participate in at once
    wordlist list[str] : the list of words from which the gameboards will randomly select 25 words when generated
    player_keys [pandas dataframe] : the list of player_ids and associated player_keys for use in player validation
